# samples/flixel

This sample demonstrates the use of Polymod with the Flixel framework.
It includes several sprites and text files, and demonstrates file loading using the default SysFileSystem, which loads files from folders on the local file system. It does not support ZIP files, use a different file system for that.
This sample also demonstrates the use of animated sprites.
